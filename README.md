#### Program Language Selector

By Scott Hutley

## Technologies Used

* html
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* Branching

## Purpose and Objectives

This is a project designed to take user input and determine a programming language the user might be interested in learning based upon their answers. In it's current state, all questions are yes/no with very few outcomes. Given enough time and determination however, there is ample opportunity to grow the database and subsequently provide more keenly insightful results. There is also of course tremendous opportunity to include more robust questions that allow for almost any input to be supplied while still granting a detailed, accurate result.

## Setup/Installation

* Clone the repository to your computer
* Find where you directed the folder to be cloned and open it
* Open (double-click) index.html  

## Known Issues

* No known issues, just limited outcomes.
